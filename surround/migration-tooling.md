## RackWare RMM Server
{: #migration-tooling-rmm}

RackWare's RMM migrations are an automated, easy, and convenient way to migrate existing workloads from your current location to IBM Cloud. RMM creates an exact duplicate of a running image without the burden of rebuilding or recreating template images and applications. It decouples the application stack from the underlying platform, allowing it to be ported to the IBM Cloud infrastructure with ease. RMM simplifies migration of large, complex environments through a simple interface and reduces the time required from weeks to days, reducing capital and operating expenses. RackWare RMM includes discovery, analysis, and automation features, allowing all processes to be fast, easy, and error-free. The supported use cases include:

* VMware virtual machine (On-premises) to IBM Cloud VPC virtual servers.
* Hyper-V virtual machine (On-premises) to IBM Cloud VPC virtual servers.
* On-premises physical machines to IBM Cloud VPC virtual servers.
* GCP, AWS, Azure, virtual machines and OCI Baremetal to IBM Cloud VPC virtual servers.
* Migration of popular databases (e.g., MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.).

The key benefits include the following:

* Live and Non-Disruptive Migrations.
* Highly secure and efficient data transfer.
* Auto discovery of VMware vSphere and Hyper-V workloads.
* Auto provision of target Virtual Server Instance.
* Include / Exclude Lists: Capture and sync only specific files and directories rather than entire systems.
* Delta Sync: Sync only the changed parts of files during the final data sync, drastically lowering cut-over times.
* Network optimization: bandwidth usage limitations, compression and check point restart for all sync operations.

[RackWare - CloudMotion](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/content/IBM-MarketPlace-P2P-1.3-22935832-bd76-49ab-b53e-12fc5d04c266-global?kind=terraform&format=vsi-image&version=3629c1a1-262a-4bcd-90cb-be4d1f62944b-global) can be installed via the IBM Catalog. The RMM software comes preinstalled as part of the virtual server provisioning process. After the virtual server is deployed, you can access RMM through the CLI or GUI. A license is required via contact with RackWare. For more information, visit [RackWare CloudMotion](https://www.rackwareinc.com/cloud-migration){: external}
