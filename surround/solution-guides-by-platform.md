# Surround workloads by platform
{: #surround-workloads-by-platform}

This section lists the available solution guides, reference architectures or deployable architectures by IBM Cloud platform.

A deployable architecture is cloud automation for deploying a common architectural pattern that combines one or more cloud resources. It is designed to provide simplified deployment by users, scalability, and modularity. See [What is a deployable architecture?](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understand-module-da#what-is-da).

An IBM Cloud project is a management tool that is designed to organize and provide visibility into a real-world project that exists in your organization. A project manages all of the configured instances of a deployable architecture and the resources that are related to the real-world reasons that they are deployed. See [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understand-module-da#what-are-projects](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understand-module-da#what-are-projects).

With the latest update to IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) Workload Protection, Power servers on IBM Cloud and on-premises are now supported for compliance posture management, bringing a new layer of security to your critical workloads running on PowerVS. This new capability ensures that critical enterprise applications and workloads like SAP, Oracle, and DB2, can be protected and monitored more efficiently with a comprehensive security and compliance solution.

SCC Workload Protection now provides compliance posture management capabilities for critical workloads on PowerVS, including AIX and Enterprise Linux on Power. With compliance posture management, these capabilities are designed to provide unified monitoring of your workloadsâ€™ posture to help access and manage compliance against regulatory and industry standards, such as CIS Benchmarks, in addition to advanced workload protection capabilities with vulnerability scanning and real-time threat detection for Linux on Power. See [Easily secure your IBM Cloud PowerVS Workloads with IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/easily-secure-your-ibm-cloud-powervs-workloads){: external}.

When a PowerVS workspace is created, automatically a SCC Workload Protection instance is created with cloud security posture management (CSPM) for IBM Cloud enabled enabled by default.
